        <h1>About me</h1>
            <h3>Who am I?</h3>
            <p style="margin-right: 20%;">Sina(like dinner in British) -no middle name- Behmanesh, born on 4 July 1999 (24 yo) in  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garmsar">Garmsar</a> little town in Semnan province in Iran. 
                when I was 6, my parents bought me a PC. it had Windows XP 2000 on it. good old days. started to learn how to work with computers, installing video games, watching cartoons on my own. 
                I could not do anything else but play video games, the PC became my best friend!  <br>
                Never a good student, always a computer guy. In high school 3rd grade I told my Computer teacher that I want to do some programming, then he gave me a visual basic Microsoft book to study, people think it was a curse, but I think it was a luxury! 
                In late 2016 I was introduced to Dota2, an online video game, it was a curse :D now (7/19/2023) I have played more than 5000 hours of Dota2. I could become an elite air force pilot at that time. 
                In 2017 I went to university, <a href="https://english.semnan.ac.ir/"> Semnan university</a> (please do not ask how I got accepted to be at Semnan University if I was a terrible student, maybe I explain it one day) to study software engineering (similar to computer science).
                passed the software courses like data structure, OOP programming, databases and etc. after 4 terms I decided to quit university and I did it, wanted to start my professional work, when I was 19 I relocated to  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran">Tehran</a> for my first work as a junior engineer. it was Fun!
            </p>

            <h3>An Artist?</h3>
            <p style="margin-right: 20%;">Not an artist, I enjoy art but I do not explain or create Art. I play instruments, Electric guitar (Stratocaster Fan), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setar"> Setar </a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(string_instrument)"> Tar</a>.
                you can follow my Telegram channel, I do share music and tracks I enjoy, my channel is about Blues and Rock, here is the  <u><a href="https://t.me/pinkstratocaster">Link</a></u>.

            <h3>An engineer?</h3>
            <p style="margin-right: 20%;">My definition of the word "Engineering" is a bit different, if you can build, design and maintain a system then you are an engineer! i have built systems, servers and softwares on my own, and i have been maintained them for years, i think i can call myself an engineer.
