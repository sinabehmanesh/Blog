            I do not have any web design or frontend knowledge, that is why this website looks like 90's. <br>
            but the backend is pretty good, that is because i am a server engineer, i know how things work back there. <br>

            <h3>Who am I?</h3>
            <p>Sina(like dinner in british) -no middle name- Behmanesh, born on 4 july 1999 (24 yo) in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garmsar">Garmsar</a> little town in Semnan province in Iran.
                when i was 6, my parents bought me a PC. it had Windows XP 2000 on it. good old days. started to learn how to work with Computer, installing video games, watching cartoons on my own.
                i could not do anything else but playing video games, the PC became the best friend! <br>
                Never a good student, always a computer guy. high schools 3rd grade i told my Computer teacher that i want to do some programming, then he gave me visual basic microsoft book to study, people think it was a curse, i think it was a luxury!
                late 2016 i was introduced to Dota2, a online vidoe game, it was a curse :D now (7/19/2023) i have played more than 5000 hours Dota2. i could become an elite air force poilt in that time.
                2017 i went to university, <a href="https://english.semnan.ac.ir/"> Semnan university</a>(please do not ask how i got accepted to be at semnan university if i was a terrible student, maybe i explain it one day) to study software engineering (similar to computer sience).
                passed the software courses like data structure, OOP programming, databases and etc. after 4 terms i decided to quit university and i did it, wanted to start my professional work, when i was 19 i relocated to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran">Tehran</a> for my first work as a jounior engineer. it was Fun!
